### Dropbox

1. Create a new app on developer console (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create)
2. Go to permissions tab > enable `files.content.write` & `files.content.read` and click "Submit" to save your changes.
   Make sure you saved these changes **before** you generate your access token
3. Go to Settings > OAuth 2 > Generate access token > generate > Access token expiration: "no expiration" and copy the
   generated token

> Long-lived tokens are less secure and will be deprecated in the future.

### Nextcloud

All you need is to provide your Email, password and the WebDAV URL.

On your main Nextcloud page, click Settings at the bottom left. This should show you a WebDAV URL
like `https://my.nextcloud.tld/remote.php/dav/files/EMAIL/path/to/directory/`

* If the WebDAV URL ends with a `/`, for instance `https://my.nextcloud.tld/remote.php/dav/files/EMAIL/Documents/`: this
  indicates the uploaded file will be placed in the `Documents` folder.
* If the WebDAV URL **does not end** with a `/`, for
  instance `https://my.nextcloud.tld/remote.php/dav/files/EMAIL/Documents/somefile.txt`: this indicates the uploaded
  file will be named `somefile.txt` and it will be placed in the `Documents` folder. If a file with the same name 
  exists, it will be overwritten.
* All the folders must be present

### Google Drive

> This is a pretty tedious task. If someone knows a better way to do this, please let me know.

1. Login to your [google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Open [cloud-resource-manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) and create a project.
3. Go to the [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com) page
4. Make sure in the top left corner you've selected your newly created project
5. Click "Enable" (if Google Driver API is already enabled for your project, you will see a "Manage" button. In that
   case you can continue with the next step)
6. Open the [credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
7. Click "Create credentials" and select "Service Account"
8. Give it a name and click "DONE" (You can ignore the other steps)
9. You will see your newly created service account E-Mail address under the "Service Accounts" section. Click on that
   account.
10. Copy the E-Mail address of your service account since you will need it later.
11. Keys -> Add Key -> Create new key -> JSON and download that file
12. Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json` and move it to the project root directory. The path to this 
    file is the value for your `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
    Alternatively, if you don't want to keep a `credentials.json` file, you could copy the contents of 
    `credentials.json` file and provide it as a value to your `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_JSON` environment variable.
13. Login to your [Google Drive account](https://drive.google.com/drive/) and select the folder you want your notion
    backups to be saved in. You need to share that folder with the service account you've just created. Right click on
    the folder -> Share -> enter the E-Mail address of your service account. (The email of your service account will 
    probably look something like `XXX@XXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. This is the value for your 
    `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable.)
14. Open that folder by double-clicking on it. You will now be able to see the id of that folder in the URL. It 
    should look something like `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/62F2faJbVasSGsYGyQzBeGSc2-k7GOZg2`. The ID 
    (only the last part `62F2faJbVasSGsYGyQzBeGSc2-k7GOZg2` of the URL) is the value for 
    your `GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` environment variable.

### pCloud

1. Go to the [pCloud Developer App Console](https://docs.pcloud.com/my_apps/) and create a new application.
2. Choose if you want the app to have only access to a specific app folder or your complete cloud and make sure to give it write access.
3. Open a browser and enter the following URL with `<CLIENT_ID>` replaced by the client ID shown in the developer console.

```
https://my.pcloud.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code
```

4. Log in to pCloud and allow the app access to your account
5. Copy the shown hostname into the `PCLOUD_API_HOST` environment variable
6. Copy the shown access code to some editor for later use (referred to as `ACCESS_CODE`)
7. Make the following HTTP GET request with the placeholders being replaced by the actual values

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://<PCLOUD_API_HOST>/oauth2_token?code=<ACCESS_CODE>&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>'
```

8. Copy the `access_token` value from the response into the `PCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable

If you want to upload files to the root of your app folder/cloud, then you are done here.
Otherwise, if you want to upload files to a specific folder, do the following steps to find the folder ID of your target folder.

1. Open the [root directory](https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager) of your cloud in the browser.
2. (Optional) Create the folder where you want to upload the files. 
   Note that if you have chosen to give your app only access to a specific private app folder, 
   go look for a folder with your app name in the `Applications` directory of the root directory of your cloud.
   By default, all files will be uploaded there and you don't need to specifically set the folder ID. 
   However, if desired, you can also create another subfolder there.
3. Navigate to the exact folder where you want the files to be uploaded.
4. Look at the URL bar of your browser and copy the value of the `folder=<FOLDER_ID>` parameter 
   into the `PCLOUD_FOLDER_ID` environment variable.
